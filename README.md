# Abstracting-Real-Object-Project
# Project Description
This project creates an airplane object. The goal of this project is to write a main class with a secondary class. The main object has an instance variable that is an object of the secondary class. Users can expect airplane object to be printed along with four outcomes of actions that the airplane can do. This program is unique because it creates an airplane object with instance variables including the airline of the airplane, the departure and destination locations, the flight duration, the arrival or departure gate and the number of passengers in the airplane. 
# Features 
- Airline object with one instance variable; a string airline name variable
- Airplane object with six instance variables; an Airline airline name variable, a string destination, a string departure, an integer duration, an integer gate, and integer passengers
- Airplane object methods; the airplane can report the halfway mark of the flight, the airplane can take a detour, the airplane can crash, the airplane can depart from its gate
# How the Code Works
- Main class: Airplane Class
- Secondary class: Airline Class
- Tester class: Tester class
- The airline object in the secondary class is used as an instance variable in the main airplane class. In the tester class, airline objects are constructed and utilized in the construction of the airplane objects. The tester class uses these airplane objects to print and perform the airplane class methods.
# How to Run the Program
- Have Airplane class, Airline class and Tester class open
- Run main method in tester class
# Author Info
- Kim Nguyen
- I learned how to construct main classes and secondary classes. I got used to the specific formatting of the accessor and mutator methods, alongwith the constructors.
